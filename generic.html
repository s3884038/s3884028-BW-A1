										<h1>My Profile & Ideal Job</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>My ideal job would be as a game director. I enjoy overseeing the different aspects of a project and discussing how they might come together under a vision, and the management necessary for outcomes. I enjoy the idea of getting to know people and their strengths and providing them a work environment that enables them to do their best. My interests mostly lie in game design and story; I enjoy daydreaming about ways to weave these two elements together to create new combinations and experiences. 

										A game director requires a broad knowledge and experience of the gaming industry, the different aspects required to fulfil a project, and of market demand (unless he wishes to make a statement i.e. not focus on delivering a highly marketable product, in which case this is less important). Most important, of course, is his passion and his vision. It's also important to get along with people, to be able to inspire them, to manage them, and to delegate work. 

										For a game director, qualifications are unimportant - you need experience, funding, competence and a vision above all else. Competence can be demonstrated through a portfolio, and a reputation in any area of the field builds confidence when delivering an idea or a plan. 

										I could go on about how passion and vision are innate qualities. Personally, the rigor of the market or the business world has never suited my style. It is not paradoxical when I say I believe in hard work - I believe in the necessity of self-belief. Mostly I'm an auto-didact. In eastern mysticism study is a form of kriya - meaning an inward action, not something that can be taught like a machine can be programmed. For example, how did Christopher Nolan develop the skills needed to produce high quality work? He didn't go to film school. He just shot movies with what he had, developing his skills as he went. 

										Here is an example route to entering as a script writer: read and develop ideas, learn about programming, games and modern culture through study, create a work and build a portfolio over 1-3 years, then start applying.

Learning style test - Visual 
										
Big 5 - Low on all scores 
										
I take test results with a pinch of salt, but generally these results mean I would prefer a creative position where my opinion or vision has some value to the project. I enjoy observing things from a distance, processing the information on my own, and then returning to the group with an insight or plan for action. This means that when forming a team I will look for a vision or project I'm passionate about (for example, a site that delivers ancient health wisdom in an interactive and accessible way), or for people who are inspired by what I see.
