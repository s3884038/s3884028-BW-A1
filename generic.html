										<h1>My Profile & Ideal Job</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Personally, my ideal job is to be a self-employed director working on a small-scale project, so naturally the job isn’t listed. However, learning skills such as JavaScript and having a demonstrable portfolio would keep options open for me as a Java developer which is in moderate demand. 
From what I’ve seen, the top three skills Burning Glass has identified are generally accurate across the industry: communication skills, (self-)organizational skills and problem-solving skills. I get a serotonin release from being direct and moving things forward in an efficient manner, so this would suit me. Creativity, writing, planning and project management are also important skills for a game director, so doubtless there are many suitable pathways to gain industry experience. 
The top three skills in demand that I do not have are: 
SQL, Business Management and Business Analysis. (Industry specific) 
Articulate and Quality Assurance/Control (General) 
It’s important to me that the evaluation of an ideal job shouldn’t change on such a few limited factors. People are always learning new skills, specific or not, and what matters is your fundamental drive or passion to learn and grow in the first place. For some location may be the ultimate limiting factor when choosing a job, or timing – there are many things. Especially in areas such as graphic design, somebody just looking for money will not produce high quality work and therefore is less likely to secure a job in a competitive market in the first place, so really this mentality makes little logical sense. If one does something that you are good at and believe in they are more likely to do well, so it’s best for everyone’s sake that we remain true to ourselves.

										<h2>My Personality Profile</h2>

									<p>MBTI - INxJ
										
Learning style test - Visual 
										
Big 5 - Low on all scores 
										
Being an introverted, focused and driven person could cause conflicts in teams when I would like to pursue my own insights, so for me it would be important to respect what other people want and act with this in mind.
