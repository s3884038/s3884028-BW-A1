										<h2 id="content">Project Idea</h2>
										<p>My idea is to develop an app or website that provides users with foundational knowledge in varying systems of health (ayurveda, TCM, etc.) and helps them understand why Western medicine as a standalone system is incomplete. The site would also be interactive and feature tools to help them understand their own unique physiology in terms of genetic archetypes and old concepts (three doshas, body's interaction with climate, organ health, etc.) The most important part of this website would be the accuracy of the interactive tools and the programmer's ability to provide user-tailored results according to various systems. </p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Motivation</h3>
												<p>The project would be useful because our understanding of the physical universe is changing like a tidal wave building far from the shore. Modern science is far from the rigid Darwinian ideal it was in the middle of the 20th century; we now know energy is a much more subtle happening than we thought it was, that we are far more involved in it than we thought we were, and that ancient wisdom is (although less accurate than Western science) not the archaic rubbish we thought it was. In short, people need new ideas undistorted by the capitalistic world to inform their everyday actions and health is an accessible gateway into this. </p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Description</h3>
												<p>The website would feature a blog by health professionals following a stream-of-consciousness, long-term breakdown of common doubts and misconceptions and a long-term buildup of the fundamentals of each science. Concepts such as the five elements and yin/yang of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the three doshas and six tastes of ayurveda, and the way lectins in foods interact with blood-type antigens. The blog would link certain imbalances and deficiencies to common diseases and give practical and general advice/strategies to manage disease with lifestyle, taking into account both the malady (the specialty of Western medicine) and the individual's constitution, energy patterns, etc. (the specialty of Eastern medicine). The idea is that in gaining an understanding of the basic concepts of nature, the seasons, the qualities of foods, etc., people will be enabled to manage their health in a proactive way and, say, test alternative measures for a short period before resorting to antibiotics from their doctors. In more advanced stages the blog could tackle topics such as "the various causes of arthritis". 

												The website would also feature a forum where users can meet together, discuss the ideas and ask other members questions to clarify their understanding. Health professionals could do Q&As or AMAs like on reddit, offering their views on misc questions such as "How does Eastern medicine view microwaves/pressure cookers?" etc. Each member would have a profile containing their energy makeup, organ health, blood type, etc. 

												The most important feature of the website (and the only thing that would make it relevant) is its ability to provide either one comprehensive test integrating the various systems, or various individual tests for each system. In the latter case, the website would have to output a general overview of that person's archetype which would evolve over time as they complete more tests. Combined with a general directory of Western diseases and the affected organs or sub-doshas and how to boost/remedy these areas, users could easily generate plans of action appropriate for their constitution.

												<h3>Tools and Technologies, Skills Required</h3>
												<p>With a skilled enough programmer the tests could be designed using JavaScript or another programming language such as Python. In the near future virtual intelligence or machine learning is used, provided there is enough medical information to train it on and therefore enough institutional support for the project. 
											The website would simply display a different profile/profile elements depending upon the archetype indicated by the specific combination of user inputs.
												
												Graphic designers would also be needed to make the information presentable; it would be light work, only one or two required.
												
												Last but not least passionate practitioners who want to share their wisdom with other people. This is the hardest area, as I don't have any qualifications</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Outcome</h3>
												<p>If the project is successful it will be a repository of information and somewhere the young, the able and the interested can go to look for alternate methods where Western medicinal solutions (antibiotics & prescription drugs) are too brutish and inefficient. The website would be a platform to promote the art of healthy living, and help people reach their full potential. </p>
