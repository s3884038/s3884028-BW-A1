									<p>As an Informations System Technician at a hospital, Zach spends most of his day managing help desk tickets, active directories and group policies, creating user accounts and imaging with the Microsoft Development Toolkit. Often he spends the day travelling from clinic to clinic and "putting out fires". Most of his interactions happen on the phone receiving tasks from other departments in the building. In Zach's position the most challenging aspect is prioritising and completing tasks on time; without a ticketing system he would find this hard to do.

Patrick Shyu is a famous Youtuber who worked as a software engineer at Google and Facebook. Similar to Zack, he thinks prioritisation and time management are crucial aspects of the job. A good workflow that is in harmony with your own nature/inclinations is critical for a good quality of life and allows one to optimise/take advantage of the software engineer's low structure environment. Most days he learns new APIs and languages and spends the rest of the day implementing his code and polishing it. His interactions are with other IT professionals and (obviously) other departments in the company (his employers, HR, etc.). As a Google software engineer high communication through-put and technical ability are the most sought-after abilities.

Masa is a 23-year-old game programmer in Japan. Most of his day is spent writing code for games. Each day he has a 30 minute scrum meeting with other workers within the same department where they review what they have written and discuss what they will do. Masa takes a nap during the afternoon, so it seems that similar to Techlead the challenging aspects of his work are time and energy management and good communication/organisational skills.

A cyber security specialist inspects logs and traffic and analyzes/amends vulnerabilities in the system. Some time is spent doing redundancy testing and other physical work at off-site centers. Cyber security specialists either deal with IT infrastructure or programming and development (most often with Python). Knowledge of the cloud, encryption technologies and deep learning are becoming more important in this field. The other aspects of his work is mostly the same as the previous three positions.

Megan is a project manager at Fintech. Every day is slightly different depending on the stage of the workflow and what needs to be done. She spends her day communicating to the members of the teams she is managing and externally with clients and writing up documentation. She has 2-3 meetings with her team members each week. Most project managers are working from the office or home. Mitigating risks is the hardest aspect of her work.

Machine Learning:
Machine learning involves computers using algorithms and statistical models to complete tasks using patterns and inference rather than concrete instructions. Whilst machine learning generally has the same application and implication across industries, which is to automate complex tasks previously requiring human attention, there are many forms of machine learning. One example of a difference is in supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised machine learning, the machine (a neural network) infers a function that maps an input to an output. This is useful when developers wish to train a program with an outcome in mind. For example, a neural network will be fed a large number of images of arthropods and in processing these images the ‘outcome’ of spider  arachnid or ant  insect will be supervised, and the network will devise an algorithm that allows it to sort through a large number of pictures and identify the arachnids and the insects. In unsupervised learning the neural network would rather cluster together all the arachnids and insects according to shared features without a classification model. Supervised learning is simpler because it uses repeatable paradigm, whereas unsupervised learning is more useful when no such paradigm exists. One example of unsupervised learning is Google’s AlphaGo/AlphaZero deep learning project. The program was named AlphaZero because of its starting from scratch, using only raw input to detect patterns that led to winning the game (chess). Its performance was much more dynamic than the stockfish engine, a program designed with concrete instructions (to search millions of lines at each position and evaluate each one by the same formula). 
											<p>
This neural network’s unprecedented performance also shows that the power of inference or ‘artificial intuition’ allows for the creation of algorithms that perform difficult tasks human beings would ordinarily consider impossible. It also shows the exponential development of the technology; it was only in the 1990s Gary Kasparov was playing against the Deep Blue engines, which were much more primitive versions of the Stockfish engines used throughout the 2000s. 
<p>
												Some of the applications of neural networks are concerning. For example, supervised algorithms can be trained to take two facial images and blend them to create a realistic and convincing face which does not exist in reality. Another example of this voice modulation software, which can take somebody’s voice and fabricate new lines of speech using only a small amount of input. In order for this to happen the program would have needed thousands of hours of audio input, and from these would have inferred patterns in tone, modulation etc. which would be used when constructing new output. 
Neural networks will allow for many mundane tasks to be automated and many complex activities to be optimized. Very likely they will determine our future’s structure. For example, the rigorous step-by-step processes used by most businesses to process and extract data from information will be bypassed by neural networks. What was once a lengthy procedure in which the resulting outcome was not worth the labor required to attain it will become a simple process, similar to how searching Google is a vast simplification of a library lookup. Businesses will use unsupervised algorithms to create new strategies based on obscure but promising insights attained from large amounts of data, home decorators will use supervised algorithms to generate example setups based on certain preferences, forensics will generate process large amounts of data to catch criminals through visual profiling and the BOS will create more optimal statistics. In short, any activity where human judgment is required a machine will soon be able to do it, and who can say what impacts this will have on the worlThe implications of neural networks on the structure of everyday life are so abstract it’s hard not to delve into philosophy. Existentially, what will be the meaning of a person’s life? A neural network’s ability to abstract and derive insights from information is already far above that of any human being’s; this essentially means that the layman will be living in a world run and optimized by gods. Depending on how people use neural networks the future could either be horrible and utilitarian and we will be nothing more than pawns, or perhaps this technology will be used for the betterment of human beings and our own intrinsically valuable pursuits. 
<p>										
Autonomous Vehicles: 
The first fully self-driven vehicles are expected to be released by Tesla in 2021. They are driven by a network trained by the company which makes real-time decisions using information from the front camera, 12 sensors placed around the car and data conglomerated from other Teslas. Each network is made of 48 separate networks, each of which takes 72,000 hours’ worth of data to train. In the future this technology will be expanded to public transport and eventually to other vehicles (transport trucks, etc.). Currently automated Teslas still need the presence of a trained driver; it will probably be at least a decade before authorities are confident enough to lift the need for a license. 
<p>
	This technology will create redundancies in any jobs requiring a driver, though this will happen slowly over time. As transport companies already run the most optimal routes for their area, little will change in this regard except for cutting costs. Eventually what it means to have a driving license will change and people’s lives will become more autonomous. 
<p>										
Natural Language Processing/chatterbots:
Natural language processing is a field of linguistics and computer science which revolves around developing software that can understand and process human language on a contextual level. This will solve problems where, for example, present search engines cannot discern the words ‘foot’ or ‘meter’ in the noun or the verb sense. This will enable vast swaths of informal information to be processed by computers (logs, notebooks, etc.) where previously people would have to be trained to format their information (i.e., as formal reports) in a way that computers and end-users could categorically sort through. 
<p>
	Chatterbots use features developed by experts in the NLP field (word sense disambiguation, speech recognition and generation, etc.) to provide an artificial interface that responds in the same way a human does. Generally, these are used by businesses to provide a better customer experience e.g. widely used by businesses as an automated ‘help desk’ feature. 
<p>
	In the future NLP is expected to advance big data analytics and make information and statistics available to consumers. The current obstacles are word similarity and relatedness and word ambiguity. Machine learning will also help make the technology more accessible as low amounts of code will be required to configure new models for specific tasks. Similar to neural networks, NLP will reveal business insights that allow for more optimal decisions to be made. 
<p>
Small Computing Devices (Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys):
Small computing devices are micro-sized computers that can take an input and produce an output, or complete more complex activities. Raspberry pis can connect to display screens and feature RAM, CPUs and GPUs which allow for internet connection, music streaming, running Minecraft, etc. Arduinos are open source micro-controllers used to build various kinds of projects – from simple automation to creative endeavors. Makey makeys work in a similar way, connecting objects with alligator clips to computers in the form of keyboard strokes or mouse clicks. 
<p>
	The main feature all these devices have in common is that they’re cheap and easily accessible, bringing the price tag for basic computer functions down to $35 or less. As technology becomes smaller and smaller computers may separate from their screens/interfaces entirely; whatever happens, small computing devices will cause a change in the structure of the computing market especially for the layman who only needs to complete simple, day-to-day tasks. Day to day life would change depending on one’s interest in these things; it’s important to remember that automation is a luxury and not a necessity. The economy is predicted to receive a boost as younger children can access/engage with electronics at a younger age, for cheaper, through a more simplified format.
